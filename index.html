  Engineer, Educator, and Entrepreneur
</p>

<h2>Career timeline</h2>
<ul class="timeline">
  <li class="timeline-item">
    <h3>Software engineering (early career)</h3>
    <p><strong>Why this choice</strong>: I wanted to build things end‑to‑end and learn the craft of software by shipping to real users.</p>
    <p><strong>Work</strong>: Full‑stack engineering across web and backend; focused on reliability, correctness, and shipping value quickly.</p>
    <p><strong>What I learned</strong>: Product thinking, debugging under pressure, and the value of boring, reliable systems.</p>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Why I moved</strong>: I wanted my work to directly advance social outcomes, which led me to the classroom.</p>
  </li>

  <li class="timeline-item">
    <h3>Teach For India — Educator</h3>
    <p><strong>Why this choice</strong>: I believed that working on foundational learning is one of the most leveraged ways to create opportunity.</p>
    <p><strong>Work</strong>: Taught 6th–7th grade mathematics and science full‑time as a class teacher for two years.</p>
    <p><strong>What I learned</strong>: How systems, incentives, and constraints shape outcomes; empathy; and designing for real‑world constraints.</p>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Why I moved</strong>: I wanted to combine social impact with technology at scale — toward AI and public‑interest systems.</p>
  </li>

  <li class="timeline-item">
    <h3>Founder — Samta.Law</h3>
    <p><strong>Why this choice</strong>: Legal information is fragmented and hard to access; retrieval‑augmented AI could lower that barrier.</p>
    <p><strong>Work</strong>: Built a GenAI‑powered legal search engine from zero to acquisition at an early stage.</p>
    <p><strong>What I learned</strong>: Operating production LLM systems, retrieval quality, evaluation, and the realities of zero‑to‑one product building.</p>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Why I moved</strong>: To apply these learnings at platform scale and contribute to India’s AI and digital public infrastructure efforts.</p>
  </li>

  <li class="timeline-item">
    <h3>Founding member — Sarvam AI</h3>
    <p><strong>Why this choice</strong>: Build production‑grade AI systems and platforms that are locally relevant and globally competitive.</p>
    <p><strong>Work</strong>: LLM systems, conversational agents, and platform capabilities used in real‑world policy and inclusion contexts.</p>
    <p><strong>What I’m learning</strong>: Building resilient AI products, safety and evaluation at scale, and ecosystem design for public‑interest tech.</p>
    <p class="muted"><strong>What’s next</strong>: Continue to build durable, useful AI systems and strengthen open, consented digital ecosystems.</p>
