  <h2>My story in brief</h2>
  <p>
    I am an entrepreneur. Over the years I wear many hats which is covered in my career timeline below. My fundamental curiosity are (a) how does the world work ? (b) what is the future of humanity ? (c) how do we make everyone wealthy ?

    The <a href="https://www.dalailama.com/messages/transcripts-and-interviews/the-purpose-of-life-is-to-be-happy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dalai Lama famously said</a> that the purpose of life is happiness. <a href="https://www.pursuit-of-happiness.org/history-of-happiness/viktor-frankl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viktor Frankl</a> said that the meaning of life is to give life meaning. In the pursuit of meaning, Frankl recommends three different kinds of experience: through deeds, the experience of values through some kind of medium (beauty through art, love through a relationship, etc.), or suffering. And Michio Kaku said that there is no fixed purpose to life but rather an active, concious strugle to define and create meaning for onself.

    I am not sure what is the right answer but it seems it will be closer to 42. Which has led me to see the world of knowledge without boundaries and combinatorial innovation as a primary way of altering the world I live in.

  <p><strong>Focus areas:</strong> Build long lasting institutions that serve society and expand our understanding of who we are.</p>

When you are close to policy you are also close to Law. This was also an interesting time when in 2019 GPT-2 (<a href='https://talktotransformer.com/' target='_blank'>Talk to Transformer</a>) which I had access to. It was clear that all spaces with large amounts of text data will get disrupted. So I thought of studying Law and Biomedical.

Proposed a project and then independently worked on data science and analytics at SISC.</p><p><strong>What I learned</strong>: Learnt about gradient boosting methods and decision trees for classification and segmentation.</p><p class='muted'><strong>Why I moved</strong>: While at Sony, I volunteered at Make a Difference and DataKind. I learnt about the complexity of society and problems. I also had horizontal tech knowledge but not deep domain knowledge. So I built a hypothesis to change the world: <br>1. Govt. is not malintentioned, it just doesn't know how to use data well<br>2. Techies like me will find it hard to get into these fields due to economics and hence I can move much faster in my learning journey<br>3. I had personally seen both impact and perils of good and bad education. That's what I wanted to change.<br><br><em>Hypothesis: Education powered with data will change the world.</em></p>"
