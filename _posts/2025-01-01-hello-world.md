Welcome — this site is now a lightweight projects page and portfolio built with Jekyll, HTML, and CSS only. No JavaScript, no trackers.

- Posts live in `_posts/` as Markdown files named `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
- The projects index is at `/projects/`
- RSS feed is at `/feed.xml`

Expect writing on AI systems, digital public infrastructure, and building production-grade products.
